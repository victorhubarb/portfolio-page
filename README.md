## Project Description
This Developer Portfolio Page is a sleek and modern web platform designed to showcase the skills, experiences, and professional background of a developer. Currently, the site features a Home page and an About Us page, with potential for expansion to include a Projects page. The design focuses on simplicity and user engagement, providing a clear and accessible way for potential employers or clients to learn about the developer's capabilities and achievements.
